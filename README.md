# COUNT TILL CARIBBEAN

This game, written in **vanilla JavaScript** and utilizing **CSS** for styling, consists of three levels of increasing difficulty. The gameplay is as follows:

1. The player must press the correct number from 0 to the maximum number displayed in the table.
2. The size of the table corresponds to the level, with the first level being a 4X4 table, the second level being a 5X5 table, and the third level being a 6X6 table.
3. Upon pressing a cell, a sound is played. 
4. If the game is completed, the **theme song from Pirates of the Caribbean** will be played as all the earlier sounds combined sound like the full theme song.
